# Emily Aikens

## About

I am a full-stack developer with a background in biological sciences and design. My STEM-based education and work experience integrated with visual arts has provided me with the ability to approach problems in a way that is both systematic and innovative. My affinity for environments that nurture intellectual growth and creativity has led me to pursue a career in software engineering and development, where the only limits in these endeavors are self imposed.

I am currently working as a Python Engineer Intern at Orion Governance.

## Goals

My devs skills are largely based in web-based apps but I'm very interested in machine learning. I hope to steer my education in that direction and eventually enter the machine learning/AI field! I would love to find a career where I can use integrate computer science with my biology or graphic design background. I'm fascinated by the environmental implications of machine learning/AI in the fisheries and oceanographic fields as well as the ethical queries surrounding the implementation and development of AI.
